    <h1>Privacy Policy for Web App Builder</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong>23/10/2025</p>

    <p><strong>Web App Builder</strong> (‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúour‚Äù, or ‚Äúus‚Äù) operates the mobile application (the ‚ÄúApp‚Äù) developed using Flutter, which allows users to view and interact with web content from their chosen website.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information from users. The app simply loads and displays web content that users choose to visit.</p>
    <p>However, if the website displayed within the app collects information (e.g., cookies, forms, analytics), that data is handled by the website itself and governed by its own privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>Since this app does not collect personal data, we do not use, share, or sell any information.</p>
    <p>If the website you load within the app collects or processes user data, please refer to that website‚Äôs own privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app may display content from external websites. Those websites may use cookies or other tracking technologies.</p>
    <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>We value your trust in using our app, but please remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.</p>
